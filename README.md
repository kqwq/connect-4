# Connect-4

## Purpose

A few days ago I was browsing LinkedIn and came across an impressive LinkedIn profile with over 100 followers. The profile listed all the of the person's computer science achievements, certifications and education. When I clicked on a link to his own project, it was a simple connect-4 game written in HTML/JavaScript. 

I wanted to show how ridiculously easy this is to code by making my own version in less than an hour. I have no formal education in computer science, just hands-on experience with some code.

## Acceptance criteria

- 2 Player mode
- Connect-4 rules
- Win-lose indicator
- Unlike original version, with restart button

## Link to game

Should be published to https://kqwq.github.io/connect-4

Update: start to finish time was 31 minutes
